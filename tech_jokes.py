tech_jokes.py

A simple Python module to generate random, family-friendly tech jokes.

This module provides a function `generate_joke()` that creates a single random
tech-related joke by combining a subject, an action, and a punchline. It is
intended for light-hearted, fun use and is suitable for general audiences.

Functions:
----------
generate_joke() -> str
    Returns a single randomly generated tech joke as a string.

Example:
--------
>>> from tech_jokes import generate_joke
>>> print(generate_joke())
Why did the programmer try to deploy? but it only returned a shrug.
