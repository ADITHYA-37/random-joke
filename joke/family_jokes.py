family_jokes.py

A Python module to generate random, family-friendly jokes suitable for all ages.

This module provides a function `generate_joke()` that creates a single, random
joke by combining a subject, an action, and a punchline. The jokes are designed
to be light-hearted, humorous, and appropriate for children, families, or any
general audience. It uses templates to format the joke in a variety of styles,
ensuring that repeated calls produce different outputs.

Modules:
--------
- random: To randomly select subjects, actions, punchlines, and templates.
- time: To seed the random number generator with the current system time.

Functions:
----------
generate_joke() -> str
    Generate a single random family-friendly joke.

Usage:
------
>>> from family_jokes import generate_joke
>>> print(generate_joke())
Why did the cat take a nap? Because it wanted to catch up on dreams!

Structure:
----------
- subjects_actions: Dictionary mapping joke subjects (e.g., 'cat', 'dog', 'child')
  to lists of possible actions.
- punchlines: Dictionary mapping each subject to a list of corresponding punchlines.
- templates: List of string templates to format the joke with subject, action, and punchline.

Example Outputs:
----------------
- "Why did the dog chase its tail? And everyone joined in the fun."
- "Ever seen a child build a huge tower? And it fell down, but giggled anyway."
- "The grandma baked cookies â€” so the grandchildren laughed loudly."

Notes:
------
- The random number generator is seeded with the current system time to ensure
  varied jokes on each execution.
- The module is designed to be imported into web apps, chatbots, or other Python
  programs for generating family-friendly humor on-demand.
- To extend the joke library, simply add more subjects, actions, and punchlines
  to their respective dictionaries.

def generate_joke() -> str:
    """
    Generate a random, simple family-friendly joke.

    The function randomly selects a subject from the predefined list, chooses a
    corresponding action, and pairs it with a subject-appropriate punchline. The
    joke is then formatted using one of several template styles to produce a
    humorous, readable output.

    Returns:
        str: A randomly generated, family-friendly joke.

    Example:
    --------
    >>> from family_jokes import generate_joke
    >>> generate_joke()
    'Ever seen a cat take a nap? And then fell asleep immediately.'
